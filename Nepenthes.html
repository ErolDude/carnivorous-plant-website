<p>Nepenthes are predominantly native to tropical Southeast Asia and surrounding areas. They can be found in hot, humid
    jungles or high up in cool mountain forests. Neps appreciate bright, indirect light, air movement and high humidity.
    Many species are much less demanding in cultivation, but they do require a certain amount of attention to thrive.
    Highland
    This group of plants compromise most of genus and can be found growing in at high altitudes in the mountains. They
    appreciate day temperatures between 75-83 Fahrenheit and require a 15-20 degree temperature drop at night, usually
    at 55-60F. Although this group of Nepenthes can handle a few months of warmer temperatures, consistent nighttime
    drops around 60 and lower are beneficial for robust growth and overall health. Humidity levels should be above 75%
    in the day with nights being 100%.

    Lowland
    These plants can be found growing in warm, humid jungles where temperatures rarely fall below 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
    Day temperatures between 84-88F are preferred. Lowlanders are understory plants and prefer less light than the
    highland species. They are great candidates for terrariums, shaded porches in humid tropical climates and steamy
    greenhouse. Lowlanders grow best with very high humidity in the 80% range.

    Intermediate
    Some species and most hybrids are considered intermediate growers. These plants are cozy right between lowland and
    highland temperatures. Day time temps between 80-85 F and nights in the 60’s seem to work well for this group. We
    find that most Nepenthes can be successfully grown in these conditions. Many hybrids are considered intermediate
    growers and they can handle lower humidity and a wider range of temperatures. These plants are great for beginners.
    This is the most important factor for Nepenthes care. Although they can be acclimated to lower humidity levels, they
    really do their best in the 70-80% range. Most homes have less than ideal humidity growing Nepenthes.
