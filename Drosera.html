<p>Sundews, also called Drosera, is another genus of carnivorous plants. There are more than 200 species of sundews.
    Sundews require different type of care from other carnivorous plants. In this complete guide, we will discuss how to
    grow and care for sundew plants at home.

    There are different species of sundews, that also look differently. There are sundews that are long and thin, while
    some have round or triangular leaves. Drosera also come in different sizes and can be very small or as big as
    bushes. Most sundews thrive in a usual soil for carnivorous plants – wet soil that is poor in nutrients (often bogs
    and fens). That is the reason why they catch and feed on insects’ juices to compensate for poor soil. But some
    sundews that live in deserted areas can survive the heat by only growing with the rain.

    For growing at home, the best soil mix for sundews is a 1:1 mix of peat moss and sand/perlite. For some other sundew
    species that inhabit hotter areas such as Australia, use a mix of sand and perlite. These are Australian tuberous
    sundews, which mostly live in tropical conditions. Most sundews thrive in full sun to part sun and develop their
    colors best in these conditions. If you keep them indoors, the best place is a windowsill. If required, use
    artificial light fixtures to provide light in greenhouses or terrariums. As mentioned, you can keep your sundews
    outdoors if the climate is suitable for them. But if the climate is unsuitable or just because you don’t want to
    keep them outdoors, you can keep them indoors.

    Indoors, you can keep sundews on a windowsill (for natural sunlight), in a terrarium or greenhouse (indoors or
    outdoors). Most popular cape sundews will be very comfortable on a windowsill. Humidity should also be high</p>
