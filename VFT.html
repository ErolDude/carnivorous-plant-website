<p> There are really only four things Venus flytrap plants require to stay healthy:

    Sunlight: At least four hours of direct sunlight a day (i.e. full sun)
    Water: rain, distilled, or reverse osmosis water only
    Soil: Nutrient poor soil such as peat moss or sphagnum moss and a pot with good drainage
    Dormancy: A yearly dormancy period in the winter months. Venus flytraps require a lot of light. They should receive
    at
    least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day with 6 to 8 hours being ideal. It is best to grow your Venus flytrap plant
    outside where it can get plenty of sun and catch its own food.
    If your Venus flytrap needs to be repotted, for Venus flytrap soil you should use a combination of peat moss and
    perlite. Many growers use a 50:50 mix of peat moss and perlite or peat moss and horticultural grade silica sand.
    Pure peat moss works well also.

    We’ve been growing Venus flytraps for over a decade now and have used many different soil types. As of the last few
    years, we’ve preferred growing in New Zealand long-fiber sphagnum moss. The flytraps grow more quickly and have few
    health issues when grown in New Zealand long-fiber sphagnum moss as long as they are repotted annually in the
    spring.
    It isn’t necessary to feed a Venus flytrap anything other than sunlight and water. If you do choose to feed it, feed
    it
    only insects and at most only a few insects a month. Feeding a Venus flytrap, or growing it somewhere that it can
    catch
    its own food, can help it grow much more quickly. When summer is over and fall has started, it is time to think
    about
    providing dormancy for your Venus flytrap. Without a dormancy period, your plant’s health will start to decline and
    it
    will eventually die.

    Venus flytraps go dormant naturally when given natural sunlight and seasonal changes.</p>
